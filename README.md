## Instructions

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

	- To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
	- To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`
	- Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app. `python run.py`

2. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

## Installation

The code was developed using Python 3.6.3. Necessary packages beyond the Python Standard Library are:
- Flask==0.12.5
- gunicorn==19.10.0
- joblib==1.0.0
- nltk==3.2.5
- numpy==1.19.5
- pandas==0.23.3
- plotly==2.0.15
- scikit-learn==0.19.1
- SQLAlchemy==1.2.19

The environment can be installed using [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MareikeHeller/disaster-response-pipeline/blob/main/requirements.txt).

### Deployment
The application is created using Flask and was deployed on Heroku. 
You can access the app here: https://disaster-response-pipeline-mh.herokuapp.com/ 

## Objective
This web app provides an interface for the automatic classification of disaster response messages into category labels.
It includes a natural language processing pipeline using a
- count vectorizer
- TF-IDF transformer
- customized transformer of sentence counts (SentenceCountExtractor)
- Random Forest Classifier

### Details
A new message can be assigned to label categories based on the underlying classifier model by inserting it the input line.

The main page shows three visualizations (plotly) on the training dataset, including:
- Labeled Messages per Category
	- *categories are medical_products, water, security, buildings, missing_people and more*
- Labeled Messages per Category by Genre
	- *genres are direct, news & social*
- Distribution of Message Genres

In case new data becomes available for model training in the future in order to improve the classification performance, the ETL & ML pipelines can be executed as described under [Instructions](#instructions). 

## File Descriptions
**app**
- templates
	- master.html & go.html
    	- *app HTML functions & design*
- run.py
	- *runs the app*
    - *loads data from database and model from pickel file (different directories for local vs. web deployment are handled using try except statements)*
    - *note: from sklearn.externals import joblib was replaced by direct import joblib*
    - *creates plotly visualizations*
    
**data**
- disaster_categories.csv
	- *raw data on categories (used as labels)*
- disaster_messages.csv
	- *raw data on messages (after transformation used as features)*
- process_data.py
	- *loads and cleans raw data*
    - *note: label counts > 1 were set to 1*
    - *saves the resulting clean data in a database with one table*
- DisasterResponse.db
	- *final clean database with one table "labeled_messages"*
    
**models**
- train_classifier.py
	- *loads data and builds the model using an ML pipeline*
    - *including GridSearch cross-validation and evaluation of the model*
    - *saves the resulting model as pickle file*
![](https://github.com/MareikeHeller/disaster-response-pipeline/blob/main/screenshots/model_metrics.PNG)
- classifier.pkl
	- *final classifier model*
    
**modules**
- utils.py
	- *contains function "tokenize" and class "SentenceCountExtractor"*
    - *tokenize: Transforms text messages (documents) into normalized & lemmatized tokens*
    - *SentenceCountExtractor: Customized transformer based on whether a message contains one or multiple sentences. Used as a boolean feature in the ML model.*
    - *was necessary to isolate from train_classifier.py & run.py for deployment with heroku*
    
**Procfile**
- *\[heroku\] app deployment*

**nltk.txt**
- *\[heroku\] contains a list of nltk corpora to be downloaded for model to classify messages*

**requirements.txt**
-  *can be used to install the python environment*
